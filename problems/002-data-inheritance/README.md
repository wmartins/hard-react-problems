# Data Inheritance

[DEMO](http://wmartins.github.io/hard-react-problems/problems/002-data-inheritance/dist/)

Sometimes, it may be useful to pass data down to children components without
passing it as a prop. For example, the logged user can be used in multiple
components, and it is boring to pass it component by component via props.

So, a better way is to use React's [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) feature.
